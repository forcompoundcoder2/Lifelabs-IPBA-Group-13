In Ancient Egypt, one of the most relevant gender issue they faced back then is  "They separated the two genders and made the menâ€™s status higher than the women.".

<span>By the help  of the mind-mapping tool we come up with some solutions. This solutions<br />
are brainstormed by me and my group-mates. We had come up with 5 solutions and<br />
this are:<br />

<p><center>(You can also refer to the image)</center></p>
1.That their Leaders shall input or change an old law and showcase the new rights for<br />
women that will have equal rights as men.<br />
2.That we can persuade the Leaders of Egypt to have women and men have equal rights.So<br />
that Adults will be informed<br />
3.To teach the children about gender equality so that they are informed about the serious<br />
topic at a young age.<br />
4.To spread the information of gender equality which also breaks the gender limit for jobs,<br />
which means that anyone can get the job despite of gender<br />
5.Thinking at this way, gender is just a sex, infact any gender can do what jobs or what they<br />
want to do. like men doing a womens job, and a woman doing a mens job. Gender is just<br />
an order of what sex you are. Any gender has the right to do what they want to do.<br />
